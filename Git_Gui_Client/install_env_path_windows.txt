Note: You must have msysgit installed on your machine. Also, the path to my git install is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Git" yours might be different. Please check were yours is before continuing.
Open Windows Environment Variables/Path Window

    Right-Click on My Computer
    Click Advanced System Settings link from the left side column
    Click Environment Variables in the bottom of the window
    Then under System Variables look for the path variable and click edit
    Add the pwd to git's bin and cmd at the end of the string like this:

;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin;C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd

Now test it out in PowerShell; type git and see if it recognizes the command.
